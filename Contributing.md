## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to Snaggle, this guide will ensure that your contributions are easily implemented:

1. Follow PSR-2 - this will ensure that all the code looks the same
2. Update the README with any changes in functionality that you've made
3. Provide tests, no feature or bug fix will be accepted without tests
4. Single feature/bug per Pull Request, it makes it easier to decipher what's going on. If there's more than one
feature in a PR, even with tests, you'll be asked to separate them out.
5. Have a clear commit history - if you have typos that are fixed in other commits, squash them so the history is
easy to follow
